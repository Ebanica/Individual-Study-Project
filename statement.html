         <b>I have always been fascinated by the indigenous people and their history. I understood the American indigenous women's condition as a universal condition of all women. "Growing Up" is a project dedicated to the American native women who overcome all oppression to sustain life through generations. In my project, I emphasized different women's expressions in some stages of their lives to make women recognize the common feelings experienced throughout their lives.

       To create my project, I used different tonal and blending techniques to explore new elegant and exciting effects and textures on canvas. "Growing Up" is a project of five charcoal and chalk drawings on canvas, 18 x 24 inches. It is a black-and-white project that reminds us of the past and the woman's role in preserving and sustaining life. My project helps women recall their feelings and makes the viewers understand the woman as the symbol of life.
